# 🗓️ Day 1

# Setting up a local development environment

Before we can actually start building Streamlit apps, we will first have to setup a development environment.

Let's start by installing and setting up a conda environment.

To create a new environment with Python 3.9, enter the following:
```sh
conda create -n stenv python=3.9
```

Activate the conda environment:
```sh
conda activate stenv
```

 Install the streamlit library:
```sh
pip install streamlit
```

To launch the Streamlit demo app:
 ```sh
streamlit hello
```
